**Local Registration and Verification Workflow:**

1. **Registration:**
   - Locals interested in hosting challenges register on the application by providing basic information such as name, contact details, and location.
   - They create a profile with a brief description of themselves, their interests, and their expertise in specific areas (e.g., cultural heritage, environmental conservation, culinary arts).

2. **Verification Process:**
   - Upon registration, locals undergo a verification process to ensure their eligibility and credibility as challenge hosts.
   - Verification may involve submitting identification documents, references, or proof of expertise in the chosen challenge category.

3. **Approval and Activation:**
   - Once verified, locals receive approval from the application administrators to host challenges.
   - Their profiles are activated, allowing them to create and manage challenges within their designated area or expertise.


**Hosting Challenges Workflow:**

1. **Challenge Creation:**
   - Verified locals access the challenge creation feature on the application's dashboard.
   - They define the details of the challenge, including the title, description, objectives, location, date, time, and registration fee.

2. **Registration Fee Setup:**
   - Hosts set a registration fee for participants to join the challenge, which contributes to the income generated from the event.
   - The registration fee is determined based on factors such as the complexity of the challenge, resources required, and potential expenses incurred by the host.

3. **Income Generation:**
   - Hosts earn income from challenges through the app by receiving a percentage of the registration fees paid by participants.
   - The app automatically calculates and processes the host's earnings based on the total number of participants and the agreed-upon revenue sharing model.

4. **Challenge Categories:**
   - Challenges are categorized based on themes such as environmental conservation, cultural preservation, community service, culinary arts, or outdoor adventures.
   - Locals choose the appropriate category for their challenge to attract participants with similar interests.

5. **NGO Collaboration:**
   - The application integrates with local NGOs responsible for specific areas or initiatives related to challenges.
   - Locals can collaborate with partner NGOs to organize and coordinate challenges, leveraging their expertise and resources for greater impact.

6. **Challenge Promotion:**
   - Locals promote their challenges within the application's community by sharing updates, photos, and invitations to participate.
   - They utilize social media channels, local networks, and community forums to reach a wider audience and generate interest in their challenges.

7. **Participant Registration:**
   - Interested participants register for challenges through the application by browsing available challenges and selecting the ones they wish to join.
   - They provide necessary information and acknowledge any requirements or guidelines set by the challenge host.

8. **Participant Communication:**
   - Challenge hosts communicate with registered participants through the application, providing updates, instructions, and reminders leading up to the challenge date.

By incorporating the registration fee setup and income generation aspect into the workflow, hosts have the opportunity to earn income from challenges through the app, providing a sustainable source of revenue for their efforts in organizing and facilitating engaging activities within the community.


**Point System:**

1. **Challenge Participation:**
   - Participants earn points for participating in challenges, with the number of points awarded based on the challenge's complexity, duration, and impact.
   - Points may also be awarded for demonstrating exceptional effort, creativity, or teamwork during the challenge.

2. **Challenge Hosting:**
   - Locals earn points for successfully hosting challenges, with points awarded based on factors such as challenge organization, participant engagement, and positive outcomes achieved.

3. **NGO Collaboration:**
   - Locals receive bonus points for collaborating with local NGOs to organize challenges, recognizing their contributions to community engagement and partnership-building.

4. **Community Impact:**
   - Bonus points are awarded for challenges that demonstrate significant community impact, such as environmental clean-up events, cultural preservation initiatives, or food donation drives.

5. **Point Redemption:**
   - Participants and hosts can redeem points for rewards such as discounts on future challenges, exclusive experiences, or donations to partner NGOs supporting local causes.

By implementing this workflow, locals can actively engage in hosting challenges, promoting community involvement, and making a positive impact on their surroundings, while participants can participate in meaningful activities, earn points, and contribute to local initiatives aligned with their interests and values.
