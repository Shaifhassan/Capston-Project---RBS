# Hotel Workflow

**1. Registration and Listing:**

- Hotels register on the app by providing information such as name, location, amenities, room types, and pricing.
- Once verified, hotels are listed on the app's accommodation section, where tourists can browse and book rooms based on their preferences and travel dates.

**2. Booking Management:**

- Hotels manage room availability, reservations, and bookings through the app's dashboard.
- They receive notifications and updates on new bookings, cancellations, and guest preferences, facilitating efficient communication and guest management.

**3. Guest Services:**

- Hotels offer personalized services to guests through the app, such as room service requests, housekeeping, concierge assistance, and local recommendations.
- Guests can communicate with hotel staff, make special requests, and access hotel amenities seamlessly through the app.
