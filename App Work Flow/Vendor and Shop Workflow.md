# Vendor and Shop Workflow

**1. Registration and Listing:**

- Local vendors and shops register on the app by providing information such as business name, location, and contact details.
- Once verified, vendors and shops are listed on the app's marketplace section, where tourists can browse and explore their offerings.

**2. Product or Service Display:**

- Vendors and shops showcase their products or services on their profile within the app.
- They provide detailed descriptions, images, and pricing information to attract potential customers.

**3. In-Store Experience:**

- Tourists visit vendors and shops in person to explore their offerings and make purchases.
- Upon arrival, tourists can use the app to view available products or services and access any special offers or discounts.

**4. Payment Processing:**

- Customers make payments for purchases directly at the shops, using cash, credit/debit cards, or other accepted payment methods.
- Vendors and shops process payments physically at the point of sale, without the need for online payment processing through the app.

**5. Transaction Confirmation:**

- After completing a purchase, vendors confirm the transaction within the app to update inventory and track sales data.
- This ensures accurate record-keeping and inventory management for vendors and shops.

By simplifying the vendor and shop workflow to focus on in-person interactions and physical payment processing at the shops, tourists can enjoy a seamless shopping experience while supporting local businesses in Hawaii. The app serves as a platform for tourists to discover vendors and shops, explore their offerings, and access any special promotions or discounts, enhancing their overall travel experience and contributing to the local economy.
