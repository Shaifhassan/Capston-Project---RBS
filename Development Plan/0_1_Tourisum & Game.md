# Tourisum & Gamification

> [!NOTE]
> Tourism industry is a service industry, which emphasises very much on experiences co-created by tourists and service providers (Vargo & Lusch 2008).

`Gamification` is a design approach that applies game-design elements and principles in non-gaming contexts to engage and motivate people to achieve their goals. It incorporates rewards for players who accomplish desired tasks or competition to engage users. The effectiveness of gamification lies in its ability to tap into the human psychological predisposition to engage in gaming. Here's the gamification information you need:

> [!NOTE]
> While designing our game, we should look for answers of some questions, such as "why tourists play games, when do they play, what types of games they prefer". In addition, considering that tourists have limited time, the games that will be designed should be less ambiguous and less compelling than other games (Fernandes et al., 2013).

**`1. Why Tourists Play Games:`**

- Tourists play games to enhance their travel experience, make their trip more memorable, and explore destinations in a fun and interactive way. Games provide entertainment, education, and engagement, allowing tourists to immerse themselves in local culture, history, and attractions.

**`2. When Tourists Play Games:`**

- Tourists play games during downtimes in their itinerary, such as waiting in line, commuting between attractions, or relaxing at their accommodations. Games can also be played during guided tours, cultural workshops, and community events, adding an interactive element to the experience.

**`3. Types of Games Preferred:`**

- Location-based Games: Utilize geolocation technology to create scavenger hunts, treasure hunts, and augmented reality games that encourage tourists to explore different landmarks, historical sites, and hidden gems across O'ahu.
- Trivia Games: Develop trivia quizzes and quizzes about Hawaiian culture, history, geography, and local landmarks to educate tourists while entertaining them.
- Photo Challenges: Organize photo contests and challenges where tourists can capture and share their experiences, encouraging them to discover unique perspectives and viewpoints.
- Puzzle Games: Design puzzle-solving activities, riddles, and brain teasers related to O'ahu's culture, traditions, and attractions, stimulating tourists' problem-solving skills and creativity.

**`4. Design Considerations:`**

- Less Ambiguity: Ensure that game objectives, rules, and instructions are clear, concise, and easy to understand, minimizing confusion and frustration among players.
- Less Compelling: Balance the level of challenge and engagement in the games to avoid overwhelming tourists with complex tasks or lengthy gameplay sessions. Games should be enjoyable and rewarding without becoming too demanding or time-consuming.

> By incorporating these game design principles into AlohaQuest, we can create a suite of interactive experiences that cater to tourists' preferences, interests, and time constraints, enhancing their overall visit to O'ahu while promoting engagement with the local community and culture.

# Aloha Quest

AlohaQuest, our goal is to design games that enhance the tourist experience on O'ahu while considering their limited time and preferences and to empower local tourism on O'ahu.

## Ways to Incoporate Gamification in Aloha Quest

**`1. Points and Rewards System:`** Implement a points-based system where users earn points for various interactions and activities within the app, such as completing challenges, booking experiences, writing reviews, or referring friends. Users can then redeem these points for rewards, discounts, or exclusive offers from partner establishments.

**`2. Badges and Achievements:`** Introduce badges or achievements to recognize and reward users for reaching milestones, completing tasks, or exploring different aspects of the app. For example, users could earn badges for visiting specific locations, trying new activities, or contributing content to the app.

**`3. Leaderboards and Competition:`** Create leaderboards to showcase top users based on their engagement, points earned, or achievements unlocked. Encourage friendly competition by allowing users to compare their progress with friends or other app users, motivating them to stay active and participate more frequently.

**`4. Challenges and Quests:`** Design interactive challenges or quests that encourage users to explore different destinations, participate in local events, or complete specific tasks. Offer rewards or incentives for completing challenges, such as discounts on future bookings, exclusive access to experiences, or entries into prize drawings.

**`5. Personalized Recommendations:`** Use gamification techniques to personalize recommendations and experiences for users based on their preferences, behavior, and past interactions with the app. Create dynamic quests or challenges tailored to each user's interests, location, or travel history to make the experience more relevant and engaging.

**`6. Social Sharing and Community Engagement:`** Incorporate social sharing features that allow users to share their achievements, experiences, and favorite destinations with friends and followers on social media. Encourage user-generated content and community interaction by showcasing user contributions, reviews, or photos within the app.

**`7. Progress Tracking and Goal Setting:`** Provide users with visual indicators of their progress and achievements within the app, such as progress bars, level meters, or completion trackers. Allow users to set personal goals, track their journey, and celebrate their successes along the way.

**`8. Feedback and Improvement Loop:`** Collect feedback from users about their gamified experiences and use this input to continuously iterate and improve the gamification elements within the app. Monitor key metrics such as user engagement, retention rates, and satisfaction scores to assess the effectiveness of gamification strategies and make data-driven decisions.

> By incorporating these gamification elements into our tourism app, we can create a more interactive, rewarding, and enjoyable experience for users, ultimately driving greater engagement, loyalty, and repeat business.
