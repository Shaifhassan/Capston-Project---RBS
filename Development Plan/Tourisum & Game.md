# Tourisum & Game

> [!NOTE]
> While designing these games, you should look for answers of some questions, such as "why tourists play games, when do they play, what types of games they prefer". In addition, considering that tourists have limited time, the games that will be designed should be less ambiguous and less compelling than other games (Fernandes et al., 2013).

For AlohaQuest, our goal is to design games that enhance the tourist experience on O'ahu while considering their limited time and preferences. Here's how we can apply this to our app:

**1. Why Tourists Play Games:**

- Tourists play games to enhance their travel experience, make their trip more memorable, and explore destinations in a fun and interactive way. Games provide entertainment, education, and engagement, allowing tourists to immerse themselves in local culture, history, and attractions.

**2. When Tourists Play Games:**

- Tourists play games during downtimes in their itinerary, such as waiting in line, commuting between attractions, or relaxing at their accommodations. Games can also be played during guided tours, cultural workshops, and community events, adding an interactive element to the experience.

**3. Types of Games Preferred:**

- Location-based Games: Utilize geolocation technology to create scavenger hunts, treasure hunts, and augmented reality games that encourage tourists to explore different landmarks, historical sites, and hidden gems across O'ahu.
- Trivia Games: Develop trivia quizzes and quizzes about Hawaiian culture, history, geography, and local landmarks to educate tourists while entertaining them.
- Photo Challenges: Organize photo contests and challenges where tourists can capture and share their experiences, encouraging them to discover unique perspectives and viewpoints.
- Puzzle Games: Design puzzle-solving activities, riddles, and brain teasers related to O'ahu's culture, traditions, and attractions, stimulating tourists' problem-solving skills and creativity.

**4. Design Considerations:**

- Less Ambiguity: Ensure that game objectives, rules, and instructions are clear, concise, and easy to understand, minimizing confusion and frustration among players.
- Less Compelling: Balance the level of challenge and engagement in the games to avoid overwhelming tourists with complex tasks or lengthy gameplay sessions. Games should be enjoyable and rewarding without becoming too demanding or time-consuming.

By incorporating these game design principles into AlohaQuest, we can create a suite of interactive experiences that cater to tourists' preferences, interests, and time constraints, enhancing their overall visit to O'ahu while promoting engagement with the local community and culture.
