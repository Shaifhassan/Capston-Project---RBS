# Gamification

## Bartle’s Player Types

Bartle’s (1996) four groups (achievers, explorers, socialisers and killers) seemed to have different preferences and perceptions as to which actions and behaviours are fun and these are described below

**1. Achievers:**

- These players are motivated by achieving goals and completing challenges within the game. In the context of tourism, achiever tourists are likely to be goal-oriented and seek experiences that offer tangible rewards or achievements, such as completing guided tours, collecting badges or points, or reaching specific landmarks.
- Encouragement: Design gamified experiences that offer clear objectives, progression paths, and rewards for completing tasks or challenges. Provide achievement-oriented features such as leaderboards, achievement badges, and virtual rewards to motivate and engage achiever tourists.

**2. Explorers:**

- Explorers are driven by the desire to explore and discover new content or areas within the game. In tourism, explorer tourists are adventurous and curious, seeking authentic and off-the-beaten-path experiences that allow them to explore new destinations, cultures, and activities.
- Encouragement: Create gamified experiences that encourage exploration and discovery, such as scavenger hunts, geocaching activities, or interactive storytelling tours. Offer immersive and interactive experiences that allow explorers to uncover hidden gems and unique attractions while providing opportunities for self-guided exploration.

**3. Socialisers:**

- Socialisers prioritize social interactions and connections with other players in the game. In tourism, socialiser tourists are outgoing and sociable, seeking opportunities to connect with locals and fellow travelers, share experiences, and build meaningful relationships.
- Encouragement: Incorporate social features into gamified experiences, such as chat functionalities, social sharing options, and multiplayer activities. Facilitate social interactions and networking opportunities through group activities, community events, and collaborative challenges that encourage socialiser tourists to engage with others and forge connections.

**4. Killers:**

- Killers derive satisfaction from competition and conflict within the game, often seeking dominance or control over other players. While this player type may not directly align with typical tourist behaviors, elements of competition or challenge can still be incorporated into gamified experiences to appeal to certain segments of tourists who enjoy competitive activities or gaming.
- Encouragement: Integrate competitive elements, such as leaderboard rankings, timed challenges, or multiplayer competitions, into gamified experiences to appeal to tourists who enjoy competitive gaming or sports. Offer opportunities for friendly competition and achievement recognition while ensuring that the overall experience remains inclusive and enjoyable for all participants.

Understanding the preferences and motivations of each player type can help tailor gamified experiences to different segments of tourists, enhancing engagement, satisfaction, and overall enjoyment of the tourism experience by utilizing UDC concept of game design. By catering to the diverse preferences of achievers, explorers, socialisers, and even killers, tourism stakeholders can create immersive and personalized experiences that resonate with a wide range of tourists and drive meaningful engagement with destination offerings.

## Marczewski's Player Types

Marczewski's (2013) model expands on Bartle's player types by incorporating both intrinsic and extrinsic motivations, providing a more nuanced understanding of user behavior in gamified systems.

**1. Socialisers:**

- Similar to Bartle's socialisers, these users are motivated by social interactions and connections with others. In the context of tourism, socialiser tourists seek opportunities to engage with locals and fellow travelers, share experiences, and build meaningful relationships.
- Encouragement: Design gamified experiences that facilitate social interactions and networking opportunities. Offer features such as community forums, social sharing options, and group activities that encourage socialiser tourists to connect with others and share their travel experiences.

**2. Free Spirits:**

- Free spirits are characterized by their desire for autonomy, creativity, and exploration. These users seek experiences that allow them to express themselves, explore new possibilities, and engage in self-directed activities.
- Encouragement: Provide gamified experiences that offer freedom and flexibility for users to explore and customize their journeys. Incorporate elements such as user-generated content, customizable avatars, and open-world exploration to appeal to free spirit tourists who value autonomy and creativity in their travel experiences.

**3. Achievers:**

- Similar to Bartle's achievers, these users are motivated by achieving goals, completing challenges, and earning rewards. In the tourism context, achiever tourists are goal-oriented and seek experiences that offer clear objectives and tangible accomplishments.
- Encouragement: Design gamified experiences that set clear goals, offer progression paths, and provide rewards for completing tasks or challenges. Implement features such as achievement badges, progress tracking, and leaderboard rankings to motivate achiever tourists and enhance their engagement with destination offerings.

**4. Philanthropists:**

- Philanthropists are driven by a sense of altruism and social responsibility, seeking opportunities to make a positive impact on others and contribute to social causes. These users are motivated by opportunities to help others and make a difference in the world.
- Encouragement: Integrate gamified experiences that promote social and environmental sustainability, community engagement, and philanthropic activities. Offer opportunities for users to support local communities, participate in volunteer initiatives, and contribute to conservation efforts, appealing to philanthropist tourists who value responsible and ethical travel practices.

**5. Players (Extrinsic Motivation):**

- Players are motivated by external rewards and incentives, such as points, badges, and prizes. Unlike the other user types, players are driven by extrinsic motivations rather than intrinsic desires.
- Encouragement: Incorporate gamified features that offer tangible rewards, recognition, and incentives for user participation and engagement. Implement reward systems, loyalty programs, and incentive mechanisms to appeal to players and encourage their continued involvement with gamified systems.

Understanding the motivations and preferences of each user type can inform the design of gamified experiences that cater to diverse tourist segments. By leveraging intrinsic and extrinsic motivators, tourism stakeholders can create engaging and rewarding experiences that resonate with different types of tourists and drive meaningful engagement with destination offerings.
