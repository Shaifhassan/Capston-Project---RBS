# User-Centered Design (UCD)

User-Centered Design (UCD) is a design philosophy and process that prioritizes the needs, preferences, and behaviors of end-users throughout the development lifecycle of a product or service. It emphasizes understanding users' perspectives, involving them in the design process, and iteratively refining designs based on user feedback. The goal of UCD is to create intuitive, efficient, and satisfying experiences that meet the needs of users while achieving business objectives.

The UCD process typically involves the following key phases:

**`Understand:`** Conduct research to gain insights into users' goals, tasks, behaviors, and pain points. This may involve user interviews, surveys, observations, and usability testing to understand user needs and context of use.

**`Define:`** Synthesize research findings to define user personas, scenarios, and use cases. Establish design requirements and objectives based on user insights and business goals.

**`Ideate:`** Generate ideas and concepts for the design solution. Brainstorm and explore different design alternatives through sketches, wireframes, and prototypes.

**`Prototype:`** Create low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes to visualize and test design ideas. Iterate on prototypes based on user feedback and usability testing results.

**`Evaluate:`** Conduct usability testing and user feedback sessions to evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of the design. Identify areas for improvement and iterate on the design iteratively.

**`Implement:`** Develop and implement the final design solution based on validated prototypes and user feedback. Ensure that the design is user-friendly, accessible, and aligned with user needs and expectations.

UCD was popularized by Donald Norman, a cognitive scientist and usability engineer, in his book "The Design of Everyday Things" published in 1988. Norman emphasized the importance of designing products and systems that are intuitive, understandable, and enjoyable to use, based on principles of human-centered design. Since then, UCD has become a foundational approach in various design disciplines, including user experience (UX) design, interaction design, and product design, guiding the development of user-friendly and successful products and services.
