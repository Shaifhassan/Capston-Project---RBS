# Gamification

## MAPS-AIM model

The MAPS-AIM model, developed by Russell B. Williams, provides a framework for understanding and analyzing gamified experiences. It stands for Mc (mechanic), As (aesthetic), Po (poetic), Sc (schematic), Tc (technologic), Rf (referent), Dy (dynamic), HE (hedonic-eudaimonic), Au (audience), In (intention), and Mt (metric). This model helps to break down the different components that contribute to a gamified experience.

**1. Mechanic (Mc):**

- Focus on the game mechanics that drive user engagement.
- Implement point systems and achievement badges for users who complete challenges related to exploring local cultural landmarks or participating in community clean-up events. Users earn points for each completed task and unlock badges for reaching certain milestones.

**2. Aesthetic (As):**

- The visual and sensory aspects of our gamified experiences.
- Design an aesthetically pleasing user interface with vibrant colors, Hawaiian-themed graphics, and intuitive navigation. Use visually appealing imagery of scenic landscapes, traditional Hawaiian motifs, and cultural symbols to create an immersive experience.

**3. Poetic (Po):**

- Infuse storytelling and narrative elements into our gamified experiences.
- Incorporate storytelling elements into the user journey, guiding users through different quests and adventures inspired by Hawaiian folklore and legends. Each quest unfolds a narrative that immerses users in the rich cultural heritage of O'ahu, fostering a deeper connection to the destination.

**4. Schematic (Sc):**

- Explore the conceptual framework of our gamified experiences. Having a well-defined schematic ensures a coherent and user-friendly experience.
- Map out the user journey from onboarding to completing challenges and earning rewards. Ensure a seamless flow of interactions, with clear instructions and progress tracking at each stage. Users can easily navigate between different quests, activities, and informational resources within the app.

**5. Technologic (Tc):**

- Leverage technology to enhance gamified features.
- Integrate augmented reality (AR) features that allow users to interact with virtual representations of historical sites, cultural artifacts, and natural landmarks. Users can use their smartphone cameras to scan QR codes or markers at specific locations, triggering AR experiences that provide immersive insights into Hawaiian culture and history.

**6. Referent (Rf):**

- Consider cultural references and contextual elements in our gamified experiences.
- Embed references to Hawaiian mythology, traditions, and local customs throughout the app. Include educational content and informational resources that highlight the significance of various cultural practices and landmarks, helping users contextualize their experiences within the broader cultural context of O'ahu.

**7. Dynamic (Dy):**

- Ensure that our gamified experiences evolve and adapt based on user interactions.
- Regularly update the app with new challenges, quests, and events to keep users engaged and motivated. Introduce seasonal themes and limited-time offers to create a sense of urgency and excitement. Dynamic elements ensure that the app remains fresh and relevant, encouraging users to return frequently.

**8. Hedonic-Eudaimonic (HE):**

- Balance both hedonic (pleasure-seeking) and eudaimonic (meaning-seeking) aspects in our gamified experiences. Provide enjoyable and rewarding moments while also offering opportunities for personal growth and fulfillment.
- Strike a balance between providing enjoyable activities and fostering personal growth and fulfillment. Offer fun and entertaining challenges that appeal to users' hedonic desires, such as scavenger hunts and trivia quizzes, while also promoting meaningful experiences that contribute to users' sense of fulfillment and connection to the local community.

**9. Audience (Au):**

- Tailor the gamified experiences to different user segments based on their preferences and demographics. Offer
- Diverse activities and quests that cater to families, adventure seekers, cultural enthusiasts, and eco-conscious travelers, ensuring that each user finds value and relevance in the app's offerings.

**10. Intention (In):**

- Clearly define the intentions and goals behind our gamified experiences.
- Clearly define the app's intentions of promoting sustainable tourism, cultural exchange, and community engagement. Align gamification elements with these intentions, encouraging users to participate in activities that contribute to these overarching goals while also providing enjoyable and rewarding experiences.

**11. Metric (Mt):**

- Establish metrics to measure the success and impact of our gamified experiences.
- Establish metrics to track user engagement, completion rates, user feedback, and social impact. Analyze data on user interactions within the app to identify areas for improvement and optimization. Use metrics to continuously refine the gamification elements and enhance the overall user experience based on user behavior and preferences.

To use the MAPS-AIM model effectively, you can conduct a comprehensive analysis of each component and tailor our gamified experiences accordingly. This model provides a holistic approach to creating engaging, meaningful, and technologically advanced gamified applications.
