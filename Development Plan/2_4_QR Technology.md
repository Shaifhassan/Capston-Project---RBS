**1. Integration of QR Code Generation and Scanning Functionality:**

- Implement QR code generation functionality for hosts, vendors, and hotels within the app's backend. Each host adventure, vendor offer, and hotel promotion can be assigned a unique QR code.
- Integrate QR code scanning capability into the app's frontend for guests. This functionality allows guests to scan QR codes presented by hosts to verify participation in adventures or activities, and by vendors to redeem discounts or perks.

**2. Guest Verification Process:**

- When guests join a host adventure or activity, the host presents a QR code generated by the app.
- Guests use the app's QR code scanning feature to scan the code, which verifies their participation and records their engagement within the app.
- This process ensures seamless and efficient guest verification, eliminating the need for manual check-ins and reducing waiting times.

**3. Purchasing and Applying Discounts:**

- Vendors create offers and discounts within the app, each associated with a unique QR code.
- Guests browse available offers and select the ones they wish to purchase or redeem.
- Upon selection, guests are prompted to scan the QR code associated with the offer using the app's scanning feature.
- The app verifies the QR code and applies the corresponding discount or perk to the guest's transaction, facilitating seamless and secure transactions.

**4. Point Redemption:**

- Guests earn points through various interactions within the app, such as bookings, participation in activities, and engagement with local Community.
- Vendors and hotels offer redemption options for points, each associated with a QR code.
- Guests navigate to the redemption section of the app and select the desired reward or perk for redemption.
- Upon selection, guests scan the QR code associated with the chosen redemption option using the app's scanning feature.
- The app validates the QR code and deducts the appropriate number of points from the guest's account, facilitating point redemption in real-time.

By integrating QR technology into our app for guest verification, purchasing, and point redemption processes, you can enhance user experience, streamline operations, and provide additional convenience and security for guests and partners alike.
