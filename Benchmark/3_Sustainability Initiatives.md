However, there may be opportunities to further involve local communities in cultural tourism initiatives and ensure their participation in decision-making processes.

However, issues such as affordable housing, gentrification, and socio-economic disparities need to be addressed to ensure that local residents benefit equitably from tourism.

**2. Comparison with New Zealand's Maori Cultural Tourism:**

- New Zealand's Maori cultural tourism sets a high standard for sustainability, emphasizing environmental stewardship, cultural authenticity, and community engagement.

Maori communities actively participate in conservation efforts, such as reforestation projects, eco-friendly practices, and wildlife sanctuaries.
- Cultural Preservation: Maori cultural tourism prioritizes the preservation and promotion of Maori culture, language, and traditions, offering authentic cultural experiences that showcase Maori values, rituals, and ancestral knowledge. Maori communities play a central role in tourism enterprises, ensuring that tourism benefits directly support cultural revitalization and community well-being.
- Community Development: Maori cultural tourism contributes to community development by creating employment opportunities, supporting local businesses, and empowering Maori communities to participate in tourism ventures. Revenue generated from tourism activities is reinvested into community projects, social services, and cultural initiatives, fostering socio-economic resilience and self-determination.
