### Our Objective

---

Focusing on empowering locals and providing a platform for them to earn income through hosting, based on a commission-based structure:

**1. Commission-Based Model:**

- Our company charges a commission fee for each booking facilitated through the app, acting as an intermediary between tourists and local hosts.
- The commission fee is a percentage of the total transaction value and is deducted from the earnings of the local host upon successful completion of the booking.
- This commission-based model ensures that our company generates revenue while incentivizing local hosts to offer high-quality experiences and attract more bookings.

**2. Financial Objectives:**

- Increase the number of active hosts and listings on the platform to expand the range of experiences available to users.
- Grow user engagement and booking volume through targeted marketing campaigns, partnerships, and promotional activities.
- Improve customer satisfaction and retention by providing a seamless booking experience, reliable customer support, and quality assurance measures.
- Enhance revenue streams through value-added services such as premium listings, advertising opportunities, and upselling of additional experiences or packages.

**3. Revenue Streams:**

- Commission Fees: Primary revenue source derived from the commission charged on each booking facilitated through the app.
- Premium Features: Offer optional premium features or subscription packages for hosts to enhance visibility, access advanced analytics, or unlock additional marketing tools.
- Advertising and Sponsorships: Generate additional revenue through targeted advertising placements, sponsorships, and partnerships with relevant brands or tourism stakeholders.
- Licensing and Partnerships: Explore opportunities for licensing the app's technology or partnering with other platforms to expand market reach and generate licensing fees or revenue-sharing agreements.

**4. Financial Review:**

- Conduct regular financial reviews to assess the app's performance, revenue growth, and profitability metrics.
- Monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) such as booking volume, average transaction value, commission revenue, user acquisition costs, and customer lifetime value.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of marketing initiatives, product enhancements, and customer retention strategies in driving revenue growth and achieving financial objectives.
- Adjust pricing strategies, commission rates, and revenue-sharing arrangements as needed to optimize profitability while maintaining competitiveness and value for users and hosts.
